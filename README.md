# 🚀 FactoryGuard-AI
### IoT-Based Predictive Maintenance System

## 📌 About the Project

**FactoryGuard-AI** is an **IoT-driven Predictive Maintenance system** designed to monitor industrial machines and predict failures **before they occur** using sensor data and machine learning.

Instead of traditional reactive maintenance, this project focuses on **early fault detection**, helping factories reduce downtime, maintenance costs, and safety risks.

This project is being built **step by step from scratch**, with a strong emphasis on **learning, clean architecture, and collaborative development**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Traditional factory maintenance:
- Fixes machines **after failure**
- Causes unexpected downtime
- Leads to financial and operational losses

### ✅ Our Solution
Use **IoT sensor data + Machine Learning** to:
- Monitor machine health continuously
- Predict failures in advance
- Enable planned and preventive maintenance

## 🧩 Tech Stack (Planned)

- **IoT / Sensors:** Simulated sensor data (real sensors later)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask / FastAPI)
- **Database:** CSV / SQLite → PostgreSQL (later)
- **Machine Learning:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React later)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
